Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

software engineering is designing, development and deployment of software systems for use in different industries. It is important because it enables the or helps in powering different aspects of life i.e agriculture whereby we use it to track climate change.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

1. emergence as a profession: moving from just coding to genuine engineering.
2. role of women: women started to play a significant role.
3. methodologies and processes: introduction of processes to streamline software creation.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

1.planning-what is the project about and what is it you want to achieve and  how to go about it.
2.defining requirements- what are the requirements of the project.
3.designing architecture-how is the software to like like. what is it based on.
4.developing project-the actual development of the software with use of code.
5.testing and intergration- testing software to see if it is working as intended.
6.deployment and maintainance- release of the product and testing in real life industrial environment.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

waterfall methodology: a phase will conclude first before the next one begins.

agile methodology: advocates feedback, adaptability and collaboration.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

software developer: developes, test and deploy software.

quality assuarance engineer: sees to it that software developed is of high quality.

project manager: manages the entire software development project in terms of timelines, logistics and costs of the project.



Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

IDEs help in development of software by reducing time taken in development by providing all necessary tools in one package.

VCSs help incontrolling versions and intergrating and collaboration of software development by teams.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

1. changing requirements- requirements always changing due to technolog changes. move with the times.
2. quality assuarance-suppressing errors. follow quality assuarance processes.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

1.unit testing-low level and close to source of application. can run qquaickly.
2.interfration testing-verifies if services are working well together.
3.acceptance-verify if a system satifies business needs.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

giving artificial intelligence solutions to generate desired outcome.it is important because it helps it reducing work by humans .


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

bake a cake.

if you are baking a cake you follow these certain instructions like mixing ingredients together and then put dough in oven for certin minutes.
